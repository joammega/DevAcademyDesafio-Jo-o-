# Dev academy checkout backend challenge

## Problem:
During cloud computing training Bruna noticed that the product listing was mocked. Yeah! We left it like that on purpose ;)

Your challenge is to help her on developing the products backend.

## To do
We have the following new endpoints in our API:
``` 
GET products/{id}
GET products/
POST products/
```
Products must follow this model:
```json
{"name": "Some interesting product", "description": "Some description", "price": 1.99, "brand": "A awesome brand"}
```
Develop the following structure of the project in `checkout/src/sales`.

## How to submit
